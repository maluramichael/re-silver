# RE-SILVER

I want to reverse engineer as much as i can of the game Silver. Here you will find all classes i found.

My ultimate goal is to create an open source silver engine. [Like Tomasz Lis did it with Dungeon Keeper](http://keeper.lubiki.pl/html/dk_keeperfx.php)

## Patches

Here you find various patches for the game that i will create.

## Classes

Everything i reversed so far as a Cheat Engine Table or a ReClass project.

## Extract assets

See [silvie](https://github.com/othias/silvie) which works great in extracting all the silver assets.
